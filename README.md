The aim of this Projects is to apply the python machine learning Algorithms basics knowledge 
gained in the curriculum .I tried to develop a Machine learning Algorithm called Random forest 
classifier on automatic detection of pancreatic cancer on basis of biomarker data such as 
plasma_CA19_9, creatinine, LYVE1, REG1B, TFF1, and REG1A.
